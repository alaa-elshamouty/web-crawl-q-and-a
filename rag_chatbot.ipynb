    "- **SentenceTransformersTokenTextSplitter:** Chunks are created based on a specific token count, which aligns well with embedding models that require token-limited inputs. Useful for tasks that involve embeddings or semantic search.\n",
    "- **CharacterTextSplitter:** Text is divided into chunks based solely on a character limit, regardless of sentence or word boundaries. Suitable for fast, simple chunking without regard for linguistic structure."
